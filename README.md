# Covid-19-pandemic-story
This is the last and final project of my Data Analytics course from CareerFoundry. It utilizes most of the skills that I learnt during the course. The objective of this project is to build an interactive dashboard visually showcasing well-curated results of an advanced exploratory analysis conducted in Python.
For this project, I chose to discuss the global impact of Covid-19. I have chosen the data from Our World in Data (OWID).
